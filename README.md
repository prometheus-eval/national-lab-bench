Official code repository for "Shoulders of Giants: Benchmarking AI agents on open scientific research problems"

The 15 tasks (original papers and their scientist-proposed follow-up directions) are listed in [task_overview.md](task_overview.md).

```

## 1. Prepare the task materials

```bash
python prepare_tasks.py                  # download each task's code/ and data/ into tasks/paper{i}/
python prepare_tasks.py --papers 1 5     # only some tasks; --dry-run shows the plan
python ocr_paper.py --overwrite          # optional: rebuild paper.md (+ images/) from paper.pdf (needs MISTRAL_API_KEY)
```

## 2. Run an agent

```bash
bash src/solver/run.sh <agent> <paper_id>
# agent: opus-4.8 | opus-5 | opus-5.5 | fable-5 | sol-5.6 | astra-6 | kimi-k3 | deepseek-v4-pro | glm-5.3
```

Each run gets a fresh workspace `runs/<agent>/paper<i>/` (a copy of `tasks/paper<i>/`); the agent writes its submission to `proposal/` and is resumed up to 5 times until the paper is complete.

Model access is chosen by environment variables set before `run.sh`:

| agent | subscription | API / gateway | self-hosted |
|---|---|---|---|
| `opus-4.8`, `opus-5`, `opus-5.5`, `fable-5` | default (`claude login`); `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` picks the account | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | — |
| `sol-5.6`, `astra-6` | default (`codex login`); `CODEX_HOME` picks the account | `OPENAI_API_KEY` (+ `OPENAI_BASE_URL`), or `CODEX_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` + `CODEX_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | — |
| `kimi-k3`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `glm-5.3` | — | `<M>_BASE_URL` + `<M>_API_KEY` (e.g. OpenRouter) | `<M>_BASE_URL` of your OpenAI-compatible server (SGLang, vLLM) |

`<M>` is `KIMI`, `DEEPSEEK` or `GLM`; `CLAUDE_MODEL`, `CODEX_MODEL` and `<M>_MODEL` override the model id (e.g. a gateway's name for it). `astra-6` needs Codex CLI ≥ 0.153.4: install a recent `openai-codex`, or point `CODEX_BIN` at a newer `codex`. A subscription usage limit pauses a run until the limit resets; it never uses up an attempt. Neither does a turn that ends while the agent's own experiments are still running: both runners wait for them first. A completion judge that fails to return a verdict is retried before it counts against an attempt. An overloaded model ("at capacity") also just pauses the run; any other API or connection error is retried at most 5 times (the same for every runner) before the run ends with what it has. With `CODEX_AVOID_CREDITS=1`, a Codex run on a plan that also holds purchased credits pauses at 98% of the plan window instead of spending them.

## 3. Judge the submissions

```bash
python src/grader/run_codex_judge.py prepare                  # prints BATCH_DIRECTORY=...
python src/grader/run_codex_judge.py launch --root <BATCH_DIRECTORY>
python src/grader/run_codex_judge.py status --root <BATCH_DIRECTORY>
```

`src/grader/run_claude_code_judge.py` takes the same commands (`prepare`, `launch`, `status`, `pause`, `resume`). Submissions are read from `runs/` (override with `SOG_SUBMISSIONS`), batches are written to `judge_runs/` (`SOG_JUDGE_RUNS`). Running `rescope --root <BATCH_DIRECTORY> --reason paper` before `launch` uses the paper's setting: the judge also sees the solver files outside `proposal/`, and the scope is repeat 1 for every submission plus repeats 2-4 for three agents (240 evaluations). To judge other agents, `prepare --agents astra-6` (directory names under `runs/`) builds a batch of just those agents, which `rescope` then sets to all four repeats of each submission; `rescope --slots-per-account N` sets the concurrent judges per account. With `SOG_CODEX_AVOID_CREDITS=1` at `prepare`, a Codex batch waits at each account's cap instead of spending purchased credits.

Both judges run on subscriptions (API keys in the environment are ignored) and pace themselves against the plan's usage windows:

| judge | login | more accounts (parallel sessions) |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | `codex login` (ChatGPT); `CODEX_BIN` selects the CLI | `SOG_CODEX_HOMES=dir1,dir2`, each logged in with `CODEX_HOME=<dir> codex login` |
| Claude Code | `claude login` | `SOG_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS=dir1,dir2`, each logged in with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<dir> claude login` |

## 4. Analyze where agents fail and check their grades

```bash
python src/grader/eval_artifacts/paper<i>/grading.py <judged_bundle.json>   # G1 integrity, G2 completeness, G3 scientist's bar
python src/grader/eval_artifacts/paper<i>/grading.py --template             # empty bundle to fill in
```

## 5. Browse the judge's verdicts

`artifacts/judge_results/gpt-6-astra/` holds all 342 GPT-6-Astra judgments of the paper's results (see `artifacts/judge_results/README.md`). The viewer shows the leaderboard (almost and strict $G_1 \cap G_2 \cap G_3$, median run time), an analysis page with every pass rate and a per-paper grid, the 15 research directions, the papers the agents wrote (`artifacts/ai_written_papers/`), and, for each submission, every rubric node grouped by the gate it counts toward, with the grade it received, the judge's reasoning and evidence, and the submission's files with the ones the judge cited:

```bash
python viewer/serve.py        # opens http://127.0.0.1:8000/viewer/
```

The viewer is a static site that reads the repository's files, so GitHub Pages can host it as is: in the repository's
Settings → Pages, deploy from the branch with folder `/ (root)`. The site opens at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`
(`index.html` forwards to `viewer/`; `.nojekyll` publishes every file unchanged).
